This is a REST API backend created using the Gin framework of Go.

### The Dataset

This project uses a database of fictional galaxies, constellations and stars.  

Here is a diagram to describe the tables and their relationships:

Stars are located in constellations, which are in turn located in galaxies.

The `galaxies`, `constellations` and `stars` tables contain the additional
fields `added_by` and `verified_by` to indicate the id of the users who made
the finding and verified it, respectively.

The database was created using SQLite.  The scripts to create the tables and
load the dummy data are included in `assets` for reference.  Note that the primary
keys of each table should actually increment automatically but are simply defined
as `INTEGER` and `PRIMARY KEY`, like so:

    CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id INTEGER,
        ...
        PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE galaxies (
        galaxy_id INTEGER,
        ...
        PRIMARY KEY (galaxy_id),
        ...
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE constellations (
        constellation_id INTEGER,
        ...
        PRIMARY KEY (constellation_id),
        ...
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE stars (
        star_id INTEGER,
        ...
        PRIMARY KEY (star_id),
        ...
    );

because in SQLite, if a column is defined as `INTEGER`
and `PRIMARY KEY`, there is no need to
define it as `AUTO_INCREMENT`.
